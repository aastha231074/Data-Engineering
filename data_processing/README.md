# Data Processing 

## 1. What is Data Processing? 
- Data processing is the collection and manipulation of data to produce meaningful information 
- It involves ingestion, transformation, aggregation, and storage of large volumes of structured and unstructured data

## 2. Types of Data Processing 

### **Batch Processing**
- Process large data blocks at scheduled intervals
- Examples: ETL pipelines, nightly data loads, monthly reports
- Best for: Historical analysis, data warehousing, scheduled transformations

### **Stream Processing** 
- Continuous data processing in real-time as data arrives
- Examples: IoT sensors, social media feeds, log monitoring
- Best for: Real-time analytics, monitoring, event-driven applications

### **Real-time Processing**
- Immediate processing with minimal latency requirements
- Examples: Fraud detection, trading systems, emergency alerts
- Best for: Critical systems requiring instant responses

## 3. Overview of Data Processing Libraries 

| Library | Key Feature | Best Use Case |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Pandas | In-memory analytics for small/medium data | Data analysis, prototyping, small datasets |
| Polars | Fast DataFrame library with lazy evaluation | High-performance analytics, modern alternative to Pandas |
| Dask | Parallel computing on larger-than-RAM data | Scaling Pandas workflows, distributed computing |
| PySpark | Distributed processing on large datasets | Big data processing, cluster computing |
| Apache Kafka | Distributed streaming platform | Real-time data pipelines, event streaming |

## 4. Key Considerations

- **Data Volume**: Choose tools based on data size (MB vs. GB vs. TB vs. PB)
- **Processing Speed**: Real-time requirements vs. batch acceptable
- **Infrastructure**: Single machine vs. distributed cluster
- **Data Format**: Structured (SQL) vs. semi-structured (JSON) vs. unstructured (text/images)
